    <h3>Terraform</h3>
    <p align="justify">Throughout my career, I have consistently followed Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles for managing cloud infrastructure. I have refactored and modularized Terraform codebases to improve scalability and maintainability, migrating existing states to remote storage solutions. I have also contributed to the enhancement of open-source Terraform modules to improve cloud provider integrations.</p>

    <h3>This Webpage </h3>
    <h4>Webpage created via Github Pages</h4>
    <p align="justify">This webpage was born just like any other Github Pages, from a jekyll template and the purpose of having some internet site for myself and my projects. Then, after the first modifications and the initial content, I just kept adding elements and animations, in order to obtain a webpage to be proud of where any person can see what I am capable of. It has been made mainly with HTML and CSS, and it also adds some Google Analytics in order to keep a trace of the views. Currently, I am working in order to make it more responsive-friendly.</p>
